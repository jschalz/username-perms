# Username Permutation Generator

## Purpose

This generator was created to more easily check username combinations for human-based OSINT operations. When someone uses similar usernames across different platforms, I got tired of trying to think of all combinations of their usernames, and I'm sure I miss some. Therefore, this little script automates the process of creating permutations of usernames a user may have, given arguments from the OSINTer.

## Use

```python3 generator.py [part1 part2 part3 ... part x]```

### Arguments

Each argument is an "element" in your target's username that's commonly used. For instance, if your target's usernames usually have "tiger" and "42" in it, those would be your elements.

### Results

Results of this script will look like:
```

```

### Examples
